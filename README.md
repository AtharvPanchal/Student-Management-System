## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
USE student_db;


ADMIN TABLE
CREATE TABLE admin (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password VARCHAR(50)
);



STUDENT TABLE
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(100),
    marks DOUBLE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

# 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

- For security reasons, database credentials are not hardcoded.

- Set the following environment variables before running the project:

  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password

  On Windows (PowerShell)
  setx DB_USER root
  setx DB_PASSWORD your_mysql_password


- After setting environment variables, restart IntelliJ IDEA.
